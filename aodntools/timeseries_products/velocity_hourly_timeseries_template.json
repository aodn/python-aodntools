The DEPTH variable is calculated from the DEPTH measurements at the instrument and the HEIGHT_ABOVE_SENSOR distance corresponding to each measurement cell. The values are summarised using the arithmetic mean. Additional variables derived from the binning process are also stored: minimum, maximum, standard deviation and number of observations in each time bin. The resulting variables have dimension OBSERVATION. The variable TIME from input files and centered to the hour is concatenated into a variable TIME(OBSERVATION). The DEPTH variable from input files is averaged into the same 1 hour bin and concatenated into a variable DEPTH(OBSERVATION). If not present, fill values are stored. All output variables with the INSTRUMENT dimension are sorted in chronological order. In order to keep track of the provenance of VoI in the aggregated file, accessory variables are created."
